Disease,Description
Drug Reaction,"A drug reaction is an immunologic or non-immunologic response to a medication that results in unintended physiological changes. These reactions occur when the body's immune system identifies a drug as a harmful invader or when the chemical properties of the drug interfere with cellular processes. Symptoms often manifest as cutaneous eruptions like hives or a morbilliform rash, systemic issues such as drug-induced fever, or internal complications involving the liver and kidneys. In extreme cases, the reaction triggers a massive release of histamine leading to systemic vasodilation and airway constriction known as anaphylaxis."
Malaria,"Malaria is a parasitic infection caused by Plasmodium protozoa which are introduced into the human bloodstream through the saliva of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. Once inside the host, the parasites migrate to the liver to mature and multiply before invading red blood cells. The synchronized rupture of these blood cells leads to cyclical paroxysms of high fever, rigors, and profuse sweating. Chronic or severe cases involve the sequestration of infected cells in vital organs, potentially resulting in profound anemia, metabolic acidosis, and cerebral malaria characterized by altered consciousness."
Allergy,"An allergy is a hypersensitivity disorder of the immune system where the body reacts excessively to typically inert environmental substances known as allergens. Upon exposure to triggers like pollen, dander, or specific proteins, the immune system produces IgE antibodies that signal mast cells to release potent inflammatory mediators like histamine. This physiological cascade results in localized inflammation of the mucous membranes, leading to rhinorrhea, sneezing, pruritus, and edema. Systemic responses can involve gastrointestinal distress or respiratory constriction depending on the route of entry of the allergen."
Hypothyroidism,"Hypothyroidism is an endocrine disorder characterized by an underactive thyroid gland that fails to produce sufficient quantities of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Because these hormones are the primary regulators of cellular metabolism, their deficiency leads to a systemic slowing of bodily functions. Patients experience a decrease in basal metabolic rate, resulting in lethargy, bradycardia, weight gain despite no change in diet, and impaired thermoregulation. The skin often becomes thickened and dry, and cognitive processes may slow, leading to memory impairment and a flattened affect."
Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease that significantly accelerates the life cycle of skin cells. In a healthy body, skin cells take weeks to rise to the surface, but in psoriasis, T-cells trigger a process that forces this to happen in just a few days. This rapid turnover results in the accumulation of live skin cells on the surface, forming thick, erythematous plaques covered with silvery micaceous scales. These lesions are typically found on the elbows, knees, and scalp, and are often accompanied by intense itching, stinging, and physical discomfort due to skin cracking."
GERD,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic digestive condition that occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) becomes weak or relaxes inappropriately, allowing gastric acid and bile to reflux into the esophagus. Unlike the stomach, the esophageal lining lacks a protective mucus layer against low pH levels, leading to chemical irritation and inflammation. This results in pyrosis (heartburn), acid regurgitation, and a sensation of a lump in the throat. Over time, the repeated acid exposure can cause structural changes to the esophageal tissue, known as metaplasia, or the formation of painful strictures."
Chronic cholestasis,"Chronic cholestasis is a pathological state characterized by the prolonged impairment of bile flow from the hepatocytes to the duodenum. This may result from primary biliary damage or mechanical obstruction of the bile ducts. When bile—which contains bilirubin and bile salts—cannot reach the digestive tract, it backs up into the systemic circulation. This systemic accumulation causes intense pruritus (itching) due to salt deposition in the skin and jaundice. Because bile is essential for the digestion of lipids, the condition also leads to malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins and the presence of excess fat in the stool."
hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A is an acute viral infection of the liver caused by the HAV virus, typically transmitted via the fecal-oral route through contaminated environmental sources. The virus replicates within the liver cells, triggering an immune response that causes localized inflammation and cellular injury. Symptoms usually include a sudden onset of nausea, malaise, and abdominal discomfort in the upper right quadrant. As the liver’s ability to process metabolic waste decreases, bilirubin accumulates in the tissues, leading to dark urine and the yellowing of the skin and sclera. Unlike other forms of hepatitis, this virus does not cause chronic infection."
Osteoarthristis,"Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the progressive mechanical breakdown of hyaline cartilage, which serves as a protective cushion between bones. As the cartilage thins and wears away, the underlying bone tissue is exposed, leading to friction and micro-fractures during movement. The body’s attempt to repair this damage often results in the formation of osteophytes, or bone spurs, and the thickening of the joint capsule. This process causes deep aching pain, crepitus (a grating sound), and significant morning stiffness that typically improves with activity but worsens after prolonged use."
(vertigo) Paroymsal Positional Vertigo,"Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is a mechanical vestibular disorder of the inner ear. It occurs when small crystals of calcium carbonate, known as otoconia, become dislodged from the utricle and migrate into one of the fluid-filled semicircular canals. When the head changes position, these crystals move through the fluid and send false signals to the brain regarding the body's orientation in space. This conflict between sensory inputs creates a sudden sensation of intense spinning or tilting, often accompanied by nystagmus (involuntary eye movement) and nausea, typically lasting for less than one minute per episode."
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia is a physiological state where blood glucose concentrations fall below the level necessary to support normal organ function. Since the brain relies almost exclusively on glucose for energy, a drop in levels triggers a neurogenic response, releasing adrenaline and glucagon to mobilize stored sugars. This results in autonomic symptoms such as diaphoresis (sweating), tremors, tachycardia, and intense hunger. If the glucose levels continue to decline, neuroglycopenic symptoms emerge, including confusion, blurred vision, and slurred speech, eventually progressing to loss of consciousness as the brain's metabolic demands go unmet."
Acne,"Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous units, which include the hair follicles and associated oil glands. The condition is driven by four primary factors: overproduction of sebum stimulated by androgens, the clogging of pores by dead skin cells (follicular hyperkeratosis), the colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes bacteria, and the resulting immune response. This leads to a variety of lesions including closed comedones (whiteheads), open comedones (blackheads), and inflammatory papules or pustules. In severe cases, the inflammation extends deep into the dermis, forming painful nodules and cysts."
Diabetes,"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. In Type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells, while in Type 2, the body develops a resistance to insulin's effects. Without effective insulin, glucose remains in the bloodstream rather than entering cells for energy. This leads to osmotic diuresis, causing excessive thirst and frequent urination. The systemic lack of cellular energy forces the body to metabolize fat and protein, leading to weight loss, fatigue, and long-term microvascular damage to the eyes, kidneys, and nerves."
Impetigo,"Impetigo is a highly superficial and contagious bacterial infection of the epidermal layer of the skin, most frequently caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacteria invade the skin through minor breaks or abrasions, where they release toxins that cause the top layers of skin to separate and form small, fluid-filled vesicles. These blisters quickly rupture to reveal a red, weeping base which then dries into a characteristic thick, honey-colored crust. The infection is often itchy and can be spread to other parts of the body or to other individuals through direct contact with the discharge or the crusts."
Hypertension,"Hypertension is a chronic medical condition where the systemic arterial blood pressure is elevated, placing excessive mechanical stress on the heart and blood vessels. It is defined by the tension exerted against the artery walls during the heart's contraction (systolic) and relaxation (diastolic) phases. Over time, this constant pressure causes the arterial walls to lose their elasticity and become thickened, a process known as arteriosclerosis. Because it often presents without overt symptoms, the damage to the heart muscle, cerebral vasculature, and renal filtration system can progress silently for years before manifesting as functional failure."
Peptic ulcer diseae,"Peptic ulcer disease involves the formation of painful, open erosions in the mucosal lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine. These ulcers develop when the protective mucus layer that shields the digestive tract from gastric juices is compromised, usually due to an H. pylori infection or the chemical inhibition of prostaglandins. When the underlying tissue is exposed to pepsin and hydrochloric acid, it leads to tissue necrosis and inflammation. Symptoms include a gnawing or burning epigastric pain that often correlates with meal times, bloating, and in severe cases, internal bleeding or perforation."
Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles),"Hemorrhoids are vascular structures in the anal canal that become pathologically swollen and inflamed. They are classified as internal or external based on their location relative to the dentate line. The condition is caused by increased pressure in the lower rectum, which causes the veins to dilate and the supporting connective tissue to stretch and weaken. Symptoms include bright red bleeding during defecation, perianal pruritus, and a palpable mass or prolapse. External hemorrhoids are particularly prone to thrombosis, where a blood clot forms within the vein, causing acute, intense pain and localized swelling."
Common Cold,"The common cold is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract, primarily caused by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, or adenoviruses. The virus invades the epithelial cells of the nose and throat, triggering a localized inflammatory response and the production of excess mucus. This leads to the hallmark symptoms of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea (runny nose), sneezing, and a scratchy sore throat. Unlike the flu, the common cold rarely causes high fever or significant muscle aches, and the symptoms are generally confined to the head and neck area, resolving as the immune system clears the viral load."
Chicken pox,"Chickenpox is a highly communicable viral infection caused by the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Following an incubation period, the virus causes a systemic illness characterized by a low-grade fever and the eruption of a pruritic maculopapular rash. These spots quickly evolve into small, fluid-filled vesicles that look like 'dewdrops on a rose petal.' The lesions typically appear in successive crops over several days, meaning a patient will have spots in various stages of healing simultaneously. After the initial infection, the virus migrates to the nerve ganglia where it remains in a dormant state for the remainder of the individual's life."
Cervical spondylosis,"Cervical spondylosis is an age-related degenerative condition affecting the vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and ligaments of the neck. As the spinal discs dehydrate and shrink, the space between the vertebrae narrows, and the body may develop bone spurs (osteophytes) to stabilize the spine. These changes can lead to the narrowing of the spinal canal or the openings where nerves exit the spinal cord. Physical symptoms include chronic neck pain, stiffness that limits head rotation, and cervicogenic headaches. If nerves are impinged, it may also cause radiculopathy, resulting in tingling or numbness in the shoulders and hands."
Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is a clinical condition resulting from the overproduction of thyroid hormones, leading to a state of thyrotoxicosis. An excess of T3 and T4 hormones overstimulates the body's beta-adrenergic receptors, causing a significant acceleration in the metabolic rate. This hypermetabolic state manifests as unintended weight loss, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), palpitations, and fine tremors in the hands. Patients often experience neuropsychiatric symptoms such as irritability and anxiety, along with physical signs like heat intolerance, increased frequency of bowel movements, and in some specific cases, bulging of the eyes (exophthalmos)."
Urinary tract infection,"A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an inflammatory response to a bacterial invasion of the urinary system, most commonly caused by Escherichia coli. The bacteria usually enter through the urethra and migrate upward to the bladder (cystitis) or occasionally to the kidneys (pyelonephritis). The infection irritates the mucosal lining of the tract, causing dysuria (painful urination), a persistent and urgent need to void, and suprapubic pain. The urine may appear turbid or hematuric (containing blood) due to the presence of white blood cells and damaged tissue, and systemic symptoms like fever occur if the infection reaches the upper tract."
Varicose veins,"Varicose veins are tortuous, dilated veins that have permanently lost their structural integrity, typically occurring in the lower extremities. The condition arises when the one-way valves intended to prevent the backflow of blood become incompetent, allowing blood pooling due to gravity. This increased hydrostatic pressure causes the vessel walls to stretch, widen, and bulge beneath the skin. Symptoms include a heavy or aching sensation in the legs, localized swelling (edema), and skin discoloration. In advanced stages, the poor circulation can lead to venous stasis ulcers or the formation of superficial blood clots."
AIDS,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is the symptomatic and terminal stage of infection by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It is defined by a profound depletion of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, which are essential for coordinating the immune response. When the T-cell count falls below a critical threshold, the body loses its ability to fight off environmental pathogens. This leads to the emergence of opportunistic infections—such as certain types of pneumonia and fungal infections—and rare malignancies like Kaposi’s sarcoma. Systemic symptoms include chronic wasting, persistent lymphadenopathy, and neurological decline as the virus affects the central nervous system."
Paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"Paralysis resulting from a brain hemorrhage is a loss of motor function caused by an intracranial bleed, such as a ruptured aneurysm or a hemorrhagic stroke. When a blood vessel bursts, the escaped blood creates localized pressure and a toxic environment that kills or disables neurons in the motor cortex or the pathways connecting the brain to the muscles. Depending on the location of the bleed, this usually results in hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body) or hemiparesis (weakness). Accompanying symptoms often include a sudden, severe headache, aphasia (difficulty speaking), and loss of coordination or balance."
Typhoid,"Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi, which is transmitted through the ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water. Once ingested, the bacteria invade the intestinal mucosa and enter the bloodstream, where they are carried to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. This leads to a sustained, 'step-ladder' pattern of increasing fever, profound malaise, and abdominal pain. A characteristic sign in some patients is the appearance of 'rose spots' on the chest. The infection can lead to significant intestinal complications, including inflammation of the Peyer's patches which may result in intestinal perforation or hemorrhage."
Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver caused by the HBV virus, which is transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, or other bodily fluids. The virus can cause both acute and chronic illness by invading hepatocytes and triggering an immune response that damages the liver tissue. Acute symptoms include jaundice, dark urine, and extreme fatigue. In chronic cases, the virus persists in the body for decades, leading to a slow progression of liver scarring (cirrhosis). This chronic inflammation significantly alters the liver's architecture and increases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver cancer."
Fungal infection,"Fungal infections, or mycoses, occur when pathogenic fungi colonize the skin, hair, nails, or mucous membranes. These organisms thrive in warm, keratin-rich, or moist environments, where they secrete enzymes that break down host tissue for nutrients. Cutaneous infections, such as tinea (ringworm) or candidiasis, typically present with erythematous, scaly circular patches, intense pruritus (itching), and sometimes maceration of the skin. Deep or systemic fungal infections can occur if the fungi enter the bloodstream or lungs, leading to more generalized symptoms like fever and organ-specific dysfunction, particularly in individuals with compromised immune systems."
Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the HCV virus, which is primarily blood-borne and most commonly spread through shared needles or unsterilized medical equipment. It is often referred to as a 'silent' infection because many individuals remain asymptomatic for decades while the virus causes slow, progressive inflammation and destruction of liver cells. When symptoms do eventually emerge, they reflect advanced liver damage and include jaundice, easy bruising, and fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites). Over time, the persistent viral presence leads to extensive fibrosis and is a leading cause of permanent liver failure."
Migraine,"Migraine is a complex neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of moderate to severe headache, typically affecting one side of the head. While the exact cause is debated, it involves abnormal brain activity that affects nerve signaling and the dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Many sufferers experience a 'prodrome' phase with mood changes or 'auras' consisting of visual disturbances like flashing lights. The headache phase is usually described as a pulsating or throbbing pain that is significantly aggravated by physical activity and is almost always accompanied by extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia), sound (phonophobia), and nausea."
Bronchial Asthma,"Bronchial asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by hyper-responsiveness to various stimuli. During an asthma attack, the lining of the bronchial tubes becomes severely inflamed and swollen, the muscles surrounding the airways tighten (bronchospasm), and there is an overproduction of thick mucus. This combination significantly narrows the passage for air, leading to respiratory distress. Symptoms include audible wheezing, a persistent 'dry' cough—especially at night—shortness of breath, and a feeling of tightness or pressure in the chest. These episodes are often triggered by environmental allergens, cold air, or physical exertion."
Alcoholic hepatitis,"Alcoholic hepatitis is a serious inflammatory condition of the liver resulting from the long-term, excessive ingestion of ethanol. The metabolic breakdown of alcohol in the liver produces toxic byproducts like acetaldehyde, which damage the membranes of liver cells and trigger an inflammatory cascade. This leads to the swelling of hepatocytes and the infiltration of white blood cells into the liver tissue. Clinical signs include a sudden onset of jaundice, abdominal swelling due to fluid (ascites), and pain in the upper right abdomen. Severe cases can lead to acute liver failure and the development of hepatic encephalopathy, causing mental confusion."
Jaundice,"Jaundice, or icterus, is a clinical sign rather than a disease itself, manifesting as a yellowish pigmentation of the skin and the whites of the eyes. It occurs when there is an excess of bilirubin—a yellow-orange pigment formed by the normal breakdown of red blood cells—in the systemic circulation. This can happen due to the rapid destruction of blood cells (pre-hepatic), a failure of the liver to process bilirubin (hepatic), or a blockage in the bile ducts preventing its excretion (post-hepatic). Besides the visible color change, it is often associated with pruritus, pale-colored stools, and dark, tea-colored urine."
Hepatitis E,"Hepatitis E is an acute liver infection caused by the HEV virus, primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route through contaminated drinking water. The virus causes an inflammation of the liver that typically results in a self-limiting illness lasting several weeks. Symptoms are similar to other forms of acute hepatitis, including fever, reduced appetite, nausea, and jaundice. While generally not chronic, the infection is uniquely dangerous in pregnant women, where it can lead to a severe form of the disease called fulminant hepatic failure, characterized by the rapid loss of liver function and a high risk of maternal and fetal mortality."
Dengue,"Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The virus enters the bloodstream and replicates, causing a sudden onset of high fever and a characteristic 'breakbone' sensation due to intense muscle and joint pain. Other symptoms include retro-orbital pain (pain behind the eyes), a generalized skin rash, and swollen lymph nodes. In a small percentage of cases, the disease progresses into Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, where the blood vessels become leaky and the number of platelets drops, leading to internal bleeding, organ impairment, and a dangerous drop in blood pressure."
Hepatitis D,"Hepatitis D, also known as the delta virus, is a unique 'satellite' virus that can only replicate in the presence of the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is transmitted through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids and can occur either as a simultaneous infection with HBV or as a 'superinfection' in someone already living with chronic Hepatitis B. The presence of the D virus significantly worsens the liver inflammation caused by the B virus, leading to a much more rapid progression of liver scarring and a significantly higher likelihood of developing liver failure or cirrhosis than with Hepatitis B alone."
Heart attack,"A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when the blood supply to a segment of the heart muscle is suddenly interrupted, usually due to a blood clot forming on a ruptured plaque in a coronary artery. Deprived of oxygen and nutrients, the affected heart tissue begins to die (necrosis). The most common symptom is a sensation of intense pressure, squeezing, or pain in the center of the chest, which may radiate to the left arm, jaw, neck, or back. Other physiological responses include shortness of breath, cold sweats, nausea, and a sense of impending doom, as the heart struggles to maintain its rhythm and pump blood."
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an acute respiratory infection that causes the microscopic air sacs (alveoli) in one or both lungs to become inflamed. When the lungs are infected by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, the immune system sends white blood cells to the area, causing the air sacs to fill with fluid, pus, or cellular debris. This process, known as consolidation, prevents the efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. As a result, patients experience a productive cough, high fever, chills, and significant difficulty breathing. The chest pain associated with pneumonia is often pleitritic, meaning it feels sharper during deep breaths or coughing."
Arthritis,"Arthritis is a general term for a group of more than 100 conditions characterized by inflammation, pain, and structural damage in the joints. While the specific mechanism varies—ranging from autoimmune attacks on the joint lining in rheumatoid arthritis to the buildup of uric acid crystals in gout—the common denominator is the destruction of joint tissues. This leads to chronic swelling, redness, and a loss of the smooth surfaces required for joint mobility. Over time, the persistent inflammation can lead to joint deformity, permanent loss of range of motion, and a significant decrease in physical strength and function."
Gastroenteritis,"Gastroenteritis is an acute inflammation of the mucous membranes of the stomach and the intestinal tract, commonly referred to as 'stomach flu.' It is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection that interferes with the intestines' ability to absorb water and electrolytes. This results in the rapid onset of watery diarrhea, forceful vomiting, and painful abdominal cramping. The rapid loss of fluids often leads to systemic dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, manifesting as dry mouth, dizziness, and extreme weakness. The condition is highly contagious and often spreads through contaminated food or person-to-person contact."
Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic and potentially severe infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily attacks the lungs, where the body's immune system attempts to wall off the bacteria, forming small hard nodules called tubercles. The bacteria can remain dormant for years (latent TB) or become active, leading to the destruction of lung tissue and the formation of cavities. Active TB is characterized by a persistent, productive cough that may bring up blood, drenching night sweats, unexplained weight loss, and low-grade fever. If untreated, the infection can spread via the bloodstream to the kidneys, spine, and brain."
