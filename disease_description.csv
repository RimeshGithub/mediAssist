Disease,Description
Drug Reaction,"A drug reaction is an unwanted, harmful, or unexpected response to a medication taken at normal doses for prevention, diagnosis, or treatment. It may appear as skin rashes, itching, swelling, breathing difficulty, fever, or internal organ damage. Drug reactions can range from mild side effects to severe, life-threatening conditions such as anaphylaxis and require immediate medical attention in serious cases."
Malaria,"Malaria is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Symptoms usually include high fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Severe malaria can lead to anemia, organ failure, coma, or death if not treated promptly."
Allergy,"An allergy is an overreaction of the immune system to substances that are usually harmless, such as pollen, dust, food, animal dander, or medications. Allergic reactions may cause sneezing, itching, rashes, swelling, breathing problems, or digestive issues. Severe allergies can result in anaphylaxis, which is a medical emergency."
Hypothyroidism,"Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones to meet the body's needs. This leads to a slowdown in metabolism, causing symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, depression, dry skin, hair loss, and slow heart rate. Long-term untreated hypothyroidism can affect heart health and mental functioning."
Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin disease that causes rapid skin cell growth, leading to thick, red patches covered with silvery-white scales. These patches may itch, burn, or crack and bleed. Psoriasis is not contagious and often follows a cycle of flare-ups and remissions, sometimes triggered by stress, infections, or injury."
GERD,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic digestive disorder where stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, irritating its lining. This backflow causes heartburn, chest pain, difficulty swallowing, and a sour taste in the mouth. Long-term GERD can lead to esophageal inflammation, ulcers, or cancer if untreated."
Chronic cholestasis,"Chronic cholestasis is a long-term condition where bile flow from the liver is reduced or blocked, leading to accumulation of bile acids in the liver and bloodstream. This can cause itching, jaundice, fatigue, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Over time, it may result in liver damage or cirrhosis."
hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A is a highly contagious viral infection that causes inflammation of the liver. It spreads through contaminated food or water or close contact with an infected person. Symptoms include fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. Most people recover completely, and the disease does not become chronic."
Osteoarthristis,"Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease caused by the gradual breakdown of cartilage that cushions the ends of bones. It leads to joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced mobility, commonly affecting knees, hips, hands, and spine. Symptoms worsen with age and overuse of joints."
(vertigo) Paroymsal  Positional Vertigo,"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a balance disorder caused by tiny calcium particles accumulating in the inner ear. It results in brief episodes of dizziness or spinning sensations triggered by changes in head position, such as turning over in bed or looking upward."
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low blood glucose levels. It commonly occurs in people with diabetes due to excessive insulin or missed meals. Symptoms include sweating, shakiness, confusion, dizziness, hunger, headache, and in severe cases, seizures or loss of consciousness."
Acne,"Acne is a common skin condition that occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. It results in pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, cysts, or nodules, mainly on the face, chest, and back. Acne is influenced by hormonal changes, genetics, stress, and diet."
Diabetes,"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder in which the body cannot properly regulate blood glucose levels due to insufficient insulin production or ineffective insulin use. High blood sugar over time can damage blood vessels, nerves, kidneys, eyes, and heart, leading to serious complications."
Impetigo,"Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection that mainly affects infants and young children. It causes red sores that quickly rupture, ooze, and form honey-colored crusts. The infection spreads easily through direct contact but usually heals without scarring when treated."
Hypertension,"Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition in which the force of blood against artery walls remains consistently too high. It often has no symptoms but increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and vision problems if left untreated."
Peptic ulcer diseae,"Peptic ulcer disease involves open sores that develop on the inner lining of the stomach, small intestine, or esophagus. It is commonly caused by Helicobacter pylori infection or long-term use of pain relievers. Symptoms include burning stomach pain, bloating, nausea, and indigestion."
Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles),"Hemorrhoids are swollen and inflamed veins in the lower rectum or anus that cause discomfort, pain, itching, and bleeding during bowel movements. They may be internal or external and are often caused by straining, constipation, or prolonged sitting."
Common Cold,"The common cold is a viral upper respiratory infection affecting the nose and throat. Symptoms include runny or blocked nose, sore throat, cough, sneezing, mild fever, and fatigue. It is usually harmless and resolves on its own within a few days."
Chicken pox,"Chickenpox is a contagious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It produces an itchy, blister-like rash along with fever and fatigue. The virus remains dormant in the body and can reactivate later in life as shingles."
Cervical spondylosis,"Cervical spondylosis is an age-related condition caused by wear and tear of the bones and cartilage in the neck. It may lead to neck pain, stiffness, headaches, and sometimes nerve compression causing tingling or weakness in arms."
Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland produces excessive thyroid hormones, accelerating body metabolism. Symptoms include weight loss, rapid heartbeat, anxiety, sweating, tremors, and heat intolerance. Untreated cases can lead to heart complications and bone loss."
Urinary tract infection,"A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection affecting any part of the urinary system, including kidneys, bladder, or urethra. Common symptoms include painful urination, frequent urge to urinate, cloudy urine, and lower abdominal pain."
Varicose veins,"Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted veins that appear blue or purple and commonly occur in the legs. They develop due to weakened valves that cause blood pooling, leading to swelling, pain, heaviness, and cosmetic concerns."
AIDS,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is the advanced stage of HIV infection, where the immune system becomes severely weakened. This makes the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers. Without treatment, AIDS can be fatal."
Paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"Paralysis due to brain hemorrhage occurs when bleeding in the brain damages nerve tissues responsible for movement. This may result in partial or complete loss of muscle function, speech difficulty, and cognitive impairment."
Typhoid,"Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella typhi, transmitted through contaminated food or water. Symptoms include prolonged fever, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea, and loss of appetite."
Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is a viral liver infection transmitted through blood or bodily fluids. It can cause acute or chronic liver disease, leading to cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer if untreated."
Fungal infection,"Fungal infections occur when fungi invade the skin, nails, or internal organs. Common symptoms include itching, redness, scaling, and discomfort. These infections thrive in warm, moist environments and vary in severity."
Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes chronic inflammation of the liver. It is commonly spread through infected blood and may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer over time."
Migraine,"Migraine is a neurological condition characterized by intense, throbbing headaches often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. Attacks can last from hours to days and significantly impact daily activities."
Bronchial Asthma,"Bronchial asthma is a chronic respiratory disease where airways become inflamed and narrowed, causing wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Symptoms are often triggered by allergens, exercise, or cold air."
Alcoholic hepatitis,"Alcoholic hepatitis is inflammation of the liver caused by excessive alcohol consumption over time. Symptoms include jaundice, abdominal pain, nausea, and fatigue. Continued drinking can lead to permanent liver damage."
Jaundice,"Jaundice is a condition marked by yellowing of the skin and eyes due to elevated bilirubin levels in the blood. It is usually a sign of underlying liver disease, bile duct obstruction, or blood disorders."
Hepatitis E,"Hepatitis E is a viral liver infection transmitted through contaminated water or food. It usually causes acute illness with symptoms such as jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain, and rarely becomes chronic."
Dengue,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease causing high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, skin rash, and bleeding tendencies. Severe dengue can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical care."
Hepatitis D,"Hepatitis D is a serious liver infection that occurs only in people infected with hepatitis B virus. It accelerates liver damage and increases the risk of cirrhosis and liver failure."
Heart attack,"A heart attack occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart muscle is blocked, causing tissue damage or death. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, and pain radiating to the arm or jaw."
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, leading to inflammation of air sacs that fill with fluid or pus. It causes cough, fever, breathing difficulty, and chest pain."
Arthritis,"Arthritis refers to inflammation of one or more joints, resulting in pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced movement. It may worsen with age and significantly affect quality of life."
